1,RIT Men’s Club Volleyball is a student-run and student-led club organization. We participate in a high level of competitive volleyball. The club generally has around 40-50 members half of which make up our competitive teams (divided into an A and B team). The other half makes up our recreational team.
2,"We host tryouts each school year at the beginning of the fall semester, typically during the second and third week of the semester. Tryouts happen over two days. The first day anyone who wishes to try out is invited to play. Every player is evaluated on their performance during the first day. If they appear to be at the competitive level, they're invited to play on the second day. In order to make the competitive team, we expect selected players to be present at both tryouts. Any player that does not make the competitive team is encouraged to play on our recreational team."
3,"The competitive team practices twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays from 8:30-10:30pm in Clark Gymnasium. We expect players to be at every practice, but we do allow excused absences with prior notice. The recreational team practices on Tuesday nights along with some Saturday practices for those interested in more play."
4,"We do not have a regular season of single matches like the NCAA, but rather we participate in scrimmage tournaments hosted by us or other colleges. In the fall semester, we go to an average of four or five of these tournaments."
5,"In the spring semester, we participate in events hosted by our league - the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball Association (ECVA). We are in the D-I North division which currently consists of RIT, Binghamton University, University of Buffalo, Cornell University, SUNY Cortland, Stony Brook University and Syracuse In the spring semester, we participate in events hosted by our league - the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball Association (ECVA). We are in the D-I North division which currently consists of RIT, Binghamton University, University of Buffalo, Cornell University, SUNY Cortland, Stony Brook University and Syracuse University."
6,"Every spring, we are guaranteed play in two league-sanctioned events. First is the ECVA-North Play Date (usually in February) in which we usually play every other team once. The host of this event changes from year to year as schools compete for the opportunity to host it. Our performance on this day determines our seeding for the second event, the ECVA-North Championships (usually at the end of February or beginning of March), typically hosted at Syracuse University. Depending on how well we do in both of these league events, we may have the opportunity to play in the East Coast Championships."
7,"Every year, we send our A team to the National Collegiate Volleyball Federation (NCVF) nationals tournament, a three-day event hosted at a different city every year. The tournament hosts around 450 club teams participating each year. Previous locations include Denver, St. Louis, Kansas City, Louisville and more."
